# **CODSOFT-Data-Science-Intern-Task-01**

Welcome to my CODSOFT Data Science Internship repository. This repository contains the code and analysis for my first task as a Data Science intern at CodSoft. In this task, I've worked on a real-world dataset related to the Titanic disaster and built machine learning models to predict passenger survival.

## Dataset
I used the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers, including their age, sex, class, and more. The dataset is available in the 'Dataset' folder. 

## Data Preprocessing
I performed various data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, deleting duplicate records and data splitting. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I explored the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable "Survived." Visualizations are available in the ' CodSoft_Task01_Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb ' file.

## Machine Learning Models
I implemented several machine learning models, including Support Vector Classification (SVC), Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The ' CodSoft_Task01_Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb ' file contains the code for each model.

## Results
The best-performing model was Gradient Boosting, achieving an accuracy of 83.58% on the test dataset. A summary of model accuracies is available in the 'Results' folder.

## Conclusion
In this task, I gained valuable experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning. I successfully built and evaluated multiple models for the Titanic dataset.

## Future Work
For future tasks, I plan to further refine and optimize the models, explore feature engineering, and consider advanced techniques to improve predictive accuracy.

## Repository Structure
- Datasets: Contains the Titanic dataset.
