# CodSoft-Data-Science-Intern-Task-01
In this repository, I have completed my first task as a Data Science intern at CodSoft. The task involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation using various machine learning algorithms. The primary goal of this project was to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using the provided dataset.
